# How to Use the Producer Chat (META-ORCHESTRATOR)

## Where to Find It

### Option 1: Prominent Button (Recommended) 🎯

When you create or open a project, you'll see the **Story Engine** screen with your brief composer. There are now **TWO buttons**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Story Engine                              │
│   Write your story logline to begin                 │
│                                                      │
│   [Text area for your idea]                         │
│                                                      │
│   ┌──────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐   │
│   │  Generate Story  │  │ 💬 Chat with        │   │
│   │        →         │  │    Producer         │   │
│   └──────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘   │
│   (Cyan/Blue button)     (Purple/Blue button)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Purple button with chat icon = Producer Chat** ← Click this!

### Option 2: Floating Button (Always Available)

If you're on any screen before generating structure, you'll also see a **floating purple brain icon** in the bottom-right corner:

```
                                    ┌──────────┐
                                    │    🧠    │
                                    │  (Chat)  │
                                    └──────────┘
                                    Bottom-right
                                    corner
```

Click the brain icon to open the Producer Chat.

## What Happens When You Click

### 1. Producer Greets You

A chat panel slides in from the right:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧠 Production Coordinator               │
│    META-ORCHESTRATOR                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  💎 Producer:                           │
│  Hey! I'm your production coordinator.  │
│  I see you're working on "New Project"  │
│  (narrative mode).                      │
│                                         │
│  Before we dive into execution, let me  │
│  understand your goals:                 │
│                                         │
│  - What's the target length and scope?  │
│  - Is this a draft/test or polished?   │
│  - Any time constraints?                │
│                                         │
│  Or just tell me what you're trying to  │
│  create!                                │
│                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Type your message here...      ] [→]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. You Describe Your Project

Type naturally, like chatting with a real producer:

**Example 1:**
```
You: "Quick 30-second character test for Sam. Just want
to see how he looks in different poses. Nothing polished."
```

**Example 2:**
```
You: "3-minute client pitch video. Needs to be polished
and professional. Deadline is next week."
```

**Example 3:**
```
You: "Experimental social media content. Rough is fine,
I'm just testing ideas."
```

### 3. Producer Asks Follow-up Questions (If Needed)

The orchestrator might ask clarifying questions:

```
💎 Producer:
Got it! A quick character test for Sam.

A few quick questions:
- How many poses are you thinking? (3-5 or 10+?)
- Any specific poses in mind, or should I suggest some?
- Do you need simple backgrounds or can I use existing locations?
```

Answer naturally, and the conversation continues.

### 4. Producer Shows Workflow Plan

Once the producer understands your needs, you'll get a tailored plan:

```
💎 Producer:
Perfect! Here's the workflow I'm proposing:

## Project Profile:
- Scale: micro (30 seconds, quick test)
- Style: rough_cut (draft quality)
- Budget: experimental (fast iteration)
- Urgency: exploratory (no deadline pressure)

## Workflow Plan:

**Phase 1: Character Setup**
  - world_builder (quick_pass) - Generate simple backdrop options
    Reason: "For a character test, we just need clean backgrounds"
  - director (standard) - Plan pose variations
    Reason: "Pose variety is the focus here"

**Phase 2: Execution**
  - cinematographer (standard) - Generate test shots
    Reason: "Quality still matters for reference"

**Skipping:**
  - ❌ scriptwriter (no story needed for character test)
  - ❌ quality_control (it's a test, not a deliverable)

**Estimated Complexity**: Low

**Recommendations**:
- Focus on pose variety over polish
- Use simple backgrounds to emphasize character
- Generate 5-8 quick iterations for comparison

Ready to execute this plan? Type "let's go" to start!
```

### 5. You Approve and It Executes

Type anything like:
- `"let's go"`
- `"sounds good"`
- `"yes, run it"`

The orchestrator executes the plan and you'll see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 world_builder: Quick backdrop setup  │
│                                         │
│    [Progress indicator]                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Results flow directly into your project!

## Why Use Producer Chat vs "Generate Story"?

### "Generate Story" Button (Classic Pipeline)
- **Fixed workflow**: Every project goes through the same steps
- **No customization**: 15-second TikTok = feature film treatment
- **Fast**: Just click and go
- **Good for**: Standard narrative projects with no special needs

### "Chat with Producer" Button (META-ORCHESTRATOR)
- **Adaptive workflow**: Different projects get different treatment
- **Context-aware**: Understands your goals and constraints
- **Conversational**: You explain what you need, it adapts
- **Good for**:
  - Character tests
  - Quick experiments
  - Client deliverables (needs polish)
  - Time-constrained projects
  - Non-standard workflows

---

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Character Reference Test
```
You: I just want to test Sam in different outfits. Super rough, no story.

Producer: Got it! Character wardrobe test for Sam.
- Skip scriptwriter (no story)
- Quick_pass world_builder (simple backdrops)
- Standard director (outfit variations)
- Skip QC (it's a test)

Ready to go?

You: yes

[Executes optimized workflow - saves time by skipping story]
```

### Example 2: Polished Client Video
```
You: 5-minute branded content for a client. Needs to look
professional. They're paying good money.

Producer: Client deliverable - got it. I'm going premium:
- Deep_dive scriptwriter (multiple script options)
- Standard world_builder (full environment setup)
- Deep_dive director (detailed shot planning)
- Deep_dive quality_control (rigorous polish)

This will take longer but deliver client-ready quality. Sound good?

You: perfect

[Executes high-quality workflow with thorough review at each step]
```

### Example 3: Social Media Experiment
```
You: Just testing a viral video idea. Speed over quality.

Producer: Experimental mode activated!
- Quick_pass scriptwriter (rough outline)
- Skip world_builder (use default locations)
- Quick_pass director (fast shot setup)
- Skip QC (iterate later if it works)

Fast and dirty - perfect for viral testing. Go?

You: let's do it

[Executes rapid iteration workflow]
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Chat with Producer button"

**Check:**
1. Do you have a project open? (Not on Dashboard)
2. Is your project idea filled in? (Button is disabled if blank)
3. Have you already generated a structure? (Producer only shows BEFORE first generation)

**Solution:**
- Create a new project
- Write your idea in the brief composer
- Look for the purple "Chat with Producer" button next to "Generate Story"

### "The chat disappeared"

The chat auto-closes when workflow starts executing. This is intentional - you'll see progress indicators instead.

**To re-open:** Click the floating purple brain icon (bottom-right)

### "Producer isn't understanding my request"

Be more specific:
- ❌ "Make something cool"
- ✅ "Quick 30-second character test, rough quality"

Include:
- **Length/scope**: "30 seconds", "3 minutes", "10+ shots"
- **Quality level**: "rough draft", "polished", "client-ready"
- **Purpose**: "testing an idea", "client deliverable", "festival submission"

## Advanced: How It Works

1. **You describe project** → Producer analyzes context
2. **AI generates insights** → Determines scale, budget, style, urgency
3. **Workflow plan created** → Routes to appropriate agents with right depth
4. **You approve plan** → Executes dynamically (not rigid pipeline)
5. **Results delivered** → Optimized for your specific needs

The producer uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** to understand natural language and make intelligent workflow decisions.

---

## Tips

1. **Be conversational** - Talk like you would to a real producer
2. **Mention constraints** - "tight deadline", "low budget", "testing only"
3. **Ask questions** - "What would you recommend?" "Is this too ambitious?"
4. **Iterate** - If the plan doesn't look right, say so and refine
